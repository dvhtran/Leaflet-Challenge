# Earthquake Visualization

This project aims to visualize earthquake data using Leaflet and JavaScript. It fetches earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed and plots the earthquakes on an interactive map. The size of the markers represents the magnitude of the earthquake, and the color represents the depth.

## Instructions

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. The map will be displayed with markers representing earthquakes. Click on a marker to view additional information about the earthquake.

4. Optional: The legend at the bottom-right corner provides context for the map data, showing the depth ranges and their corresponding colors.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries and APIs:

- Leaflet.js: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- D3.js: A JavaScript library for data manipulation and visualization.
- USGS GeoJSON feed: Provides earthquake data in GeoJSON format.
